# Digit Recognizer: Project Overview
- Correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images
- Perform a grayscale normalization to reduce the effect of illumination's differences
- Combining convolutional and pooling layers
- Alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations
