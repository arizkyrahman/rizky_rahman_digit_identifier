# Digit Recognizer: Project Overview
- Correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images
- Perform a grayscale normalization to reduce the effect of illumination's differences
- Combining convolutional and pooling layers
- Alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations

## Summary
The model reaches almost 99% (98.7+%) accuracy on the validation dataset after 2 epochs. The validation accuracy is greater than the training accuracy almost evry time during the training. That means that our model dosen't not overfit the training set.
